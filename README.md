These are my Github Projects. They involve machine learning and deep learning.

## Apparel image classification - Python

Classification of type and color of apparel for each image of the dataset using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Originally built in google colab. 
**Library**: Fastai.

## 'The Simpsons' image classification - Python

Identifying 42 characters of 'The Simpsons' using a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and a fully connected head with a single hidden layer as a classifier. The output is the predicted probability for each of the categories. Originally built in google colab. 
**Library**: Fastai.

## Emotions in tweets - Python 

Script that classifies tweets in 13 different emotions. 
**Master branch**: a model using a random forest as a classifier. 
**Neural network branch**: the model is built with a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.
**Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Nltk, Tensorflow.keras, Matplotlib.

## Sentiment analysis (movie reviews) - Python

Script to evaluate reviews about movies, classifying them with positive or negative polarities.
**Master branch**: a model built with Support Vector Machine.
**Naive_bayes branch**: a model with a class that returns the result of a voting process between Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifiers.
**Libraries**: Numpy, Sklearn, Nltk.
