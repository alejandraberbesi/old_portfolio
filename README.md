### Emotions in tweets - Python 
Script that classifies tweets in 13 different emotions: anger, boredom, empty, enthusiasm, fun, happiness, hate, love, neutral, relief, sadness, surprise and worry. In the "master" branch, the approach is to use random forest as a classifier; in the "neural network" branch the model is built with a LSTM neural network.

Script to evaluate reviews about movies, classifying them with positive or negative polarities.
There are two aproaches: On "master" branch, a model with Support Vector Machine and on "naive_bayes" branch, a model with a class that returns the result of a voting process between Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifiers.
