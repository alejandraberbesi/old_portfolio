Script to evaluate reviews about movies, classifying them with positive or negative polarities.
There are two aproaches: On "master" branch, a model with SVM that involves a LabelEncoder and TfidfVectorizer. On "naive_bayes" branch, a simple model with a class that returns the result of a voting process between Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifiers.
